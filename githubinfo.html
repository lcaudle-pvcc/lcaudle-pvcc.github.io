            <li>Repository - A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. Imagine it as a project's 
                folder, it contains all project files and stores any revision history.</li>

            <li>Fork - A personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. A fork 
                allows you to make changes to a project without affecting the original repository.</li>

            <li>Pull requests - Proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or 
                rejected by a repository's collaborators. </li>
